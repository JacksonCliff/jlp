export const confession = `You brought happiness into my life even before I knew the meaning behind your beautiful name.

After reading this, you might feel a little surprised or uncomfortable — and I’m sorry if you do. But just this once, allow me to be selfish and express what I’ve been keeping to myself.

There’s a certain “Banana” who developed a quiet crush on a girl — someone kind, intelligent, and always glowing with warmth. He didn’t plan it; it just happened. Every time she was near, his world lit up a little more. Even when she was annoyed, he found her unbelievably cute.But deep down, this “Banana” knew he wasn't the man of her dreams. He wasn’t the “Apple” of her eye. So he stayed silent, happy just to be around her, hoping that maybe — just maybe — she'd notice him one day.
And then, he heard she was leaving.

His heart sank. He felt like the ground beneath him disappeared. He was sad, frustrated, and lost — not because she owed him anything, but because fate once again decided to take someone special away from him.
For a moment, he even questioned the kindness of life itself. He wondered why someone who brought light to his days had to go. But then he realized — perhaps some people are meant to be beautiful chapters, not the whole story.
I hope you liked this little story about a “Banana.”

Please accept this farewell letter and a few gifts — small things, really, to remember a random coworker in your life. I wish with all my heart that you’ll find someone who makes you feel deeply loved and appreciated — the way you deserve.
Please take care of yourself. Keep that kindness, but protect it — the world isn’t always soft. And one day, if I see you again — smiling in a white dress, hand in hand with someone lucky enough to have you — I’ll smile too, even if from afar.

I wish you happiness, just as your name beautifully suggests.

Farewell, my favourite dream
